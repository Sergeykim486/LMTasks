>Simple manager for handling service center requests for repairing and servicing office equipment and computer hardware with on-site support.

Main functions:
- Registration of new requests in the system by the call center operator.
- Registration of new requests in the system by users (clients).
- Acceptance and execution of requests by technicians.
- Daily statistics on completed and unfulfilled requests.
- Notifying the client about changes in the request status.
- Statistics on completed requests over a period.
- Rating of technicians based on completed requests within a period.
- This bot consists of two parts: internal for the service staff and external for clients.

>The INTERNAL part is designed for service center employees.
>The EXTERNAL part is the customer-facing component that accepts requests for repairs, restorations, or technical maintenance and registers them in the database. It also provides the client with the ability to track the status of submitted requests and leave feedback and complaints. Additionally, there is a map showing the requests and their locations.

>The entire project was developed not for commercial purposes but for internal use.
